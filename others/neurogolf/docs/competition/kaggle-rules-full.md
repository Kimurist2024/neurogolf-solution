# abstract

Design the smallest possible neural networks to solve ARC-AGI image transformations (all drawn from the [ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi) benchmark suite) and discover how many parameters those tasks actually require.

# Description

Solving a task is only the first step. Doing it efficiently is harder. 

Today’s AI systems perform well on familiar tasks but often struggle with new ones. This gap is highlighted by François Chollet's [ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi) benchmark suite (and subsequent [ARC](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024) [Prize](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025) [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2026-arc-agi-2)), in which each task is presented as a series of *<input, output>* grids illustrating some specific transformation.

In this competition, you’ll work with tasks from the ARC-AGI public training set (v1) and build neural networks that reproduce each transformation. Your models must be correct—and as small as possible. You’ll submit [ONNX-formatted networks](https://onnx.ai/) and aim to jointly minimize their size and parameter count. The objective is to have a network that solves each task with as few operations as possible.

Strong solutions could help define how many layers of  computation these tasks actually require, and could serve as reference implementations and support research into more adaptable AI systems.

For example, consider the following (hypothetical) task #000:

![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F25050929%2F5bacad1e50e5c600243505312cc58d58%2Fshadows.png?generation=1759967040627883&alt=media)

Your .zip submission might include a file `task000.onnx` that embodies the following single-layer 3×3 [convolutional network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_layer):

```
def weight(channel_out, channel_in, kernel_coord):
  if kernel_coord == ( 0,  0) and channel_in == channel_out: return 1.0
  if kernel_coord == ( 0,  0) and channel_in != 5 and channel_out == 0: return -1.0
  if kernel_coord == (-1, -1) and channel_in != 5 and channel_out == 0: return 1.0
  if kernel_coord == (-1, -1) and channel_in != 5 and channel_out == 5: return -1.0
  return 0.0

network = neurogolf_utils.single_layer_conv2d_network(weight, kernel_size=3)
```

When applied to a 30×30 image grid with a channel depth of ten, the above network would require 900 parameters in total.


# data-description

The objective of this competition is to create a suite of neural networks to implement a variety of transformations, where each transformation is implicitly described by a series of *<input, output>* image grids. For example, the example pairs for one task might demonstrate the concept of *rotation*, whereas another might involve *cropping* and/or *magnification*. Your network for a given task should not only achieve the desired result across all exemplars, but also do so using the simplest possible architecture.

## Task files

The information for each of the four-hundred tasks is stored in an appropriately named json file (e.g., **task001.json**, **task002.json**). The file for a given task contains a dictionary with three fields:

- `"train"`: a list of input/output pairs originally included in [ARC-AGI-1](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI) for training
- `"test"`: a list of input/output pairs originally included in [ARC-AGI-1](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI) for testing
- `"arc-gen"`: a list of additional input/output pairs included in the [ARC-GEN-100K dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arcgen100k/the-arc-gen-100k-dataset)

A "pair" is a dictionary with two fields:

- `"input"`: the input "grid" for the pair.
- `"output"`: the output "grid" for the pair.

A "grid" is a rectangular matrix (list of lists) of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The smallest possible grid size is 1x1 and the largest is 30x30.  Before being passed into your networks, each input grid will be converted into a tensor of size `[BATCH_DIM=1, CHANNELS=10, HEIGHT=30, WIDTH=30]`, using a *one-hot channel encoding* for each colored pixel, and a *zero-hot channel encoding* for any "clear" pixels that lie outside the original border.

For all pairs in each of the example subsets (i.e., `"train"` +`"test"` + `"arc-gen"`), your submitted network should successfully construct the output grid(s) corresponding to the input grid(s). "Constructing the output grid" involves filling each cell in the grid with a `1` for the correct channel and `0` for others (or, a `0` for *all* channels if this cell lies beyond the image border). Only exact solutions (where all cells match the expected answer) can be said to be correct.

In addition, our official scoring metric will also employ a private dataset (containing a smaller number of examples per task) when validating these networks, so as to prevent overfitting.

# Evaluation

For any of the 400 tasks in the ARC-AGI public training v1 benchmark suite, your team will earn a score of `max(1, 25 - ln(cost))` for a functionally correct network whose `cost` is the sum of the following:
- The total number of parameters in the network
- The total memory footprint of the network (in bytes)

Functional correctness will be determined by validating the network against the original [ARC-AGI](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI) benchmarks and a small private benchmark suite (so as to prevent teams from overfitting their solutions).  To be eligible for points, your network must produce correct results across all of these tests.

## Submission File
You must submit a file named **submission.zip** containing at most one ONNX file per task:

    task001.onnx
    task002.onnx
    ...
    task400.onnx

*Note: if our evaluation metric requires adjustments&mdash;or, if we have to ban additional ONNX operators that compromise the aims of our contest&mdash;we will announce such changes and rescore submissions as needed.*

# Constraints

All tensors and parameters in each ONNX network file must have *statically-defined shapes* so that the performance of the network can be properly evaluated.  In addition, the following ONNX operations are disallowed: `Loop` + `Scan` + `NonZero` + `Unique` + `Script` + `Function`.  Finally, the size of each ONNX file is limited to at most 1.44MB.  These constraints will be checked automatically by our official network validator.

####4. COMPETITION DATA

a. Data Access and Use. 

1. You may access and use the Competition Data for any purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial, including for participating in the Competition and on Kaggle.com forums, and for academic research and education. The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules.</h6>

2. The Competition Data is also subject to the following terms and conditions under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) . </h6>

b. Data Security. </h5>

1. You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.</h6>

####5. WINNER LICENSE

a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:</h5>
 
1. Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org] (http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code. </h6>

2. The Winners Data is also subject to the following terms and conditions under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) . </h6>

b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.</h7>
 
####6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS

a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations). </h5>

b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):</h5>

1. Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.</h6>

2. By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.</h6>

c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)</h5>

1. Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules. </h6>

####7. ELIGIBILITY

a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.</h5>

####8. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS

a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:</h5>

1. Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should a) include the use of ONNX-networks in their final submission, and (b) it should be accompanied by an Apache 2.0 license. The delivered software code must also be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. 

a. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release). </h6>

b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,</h6>

2. Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;</h6>

3. Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).</h6>

####9. GOVERNING LAW

a. Unless otherwise provided in the Competition Specific Rules above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Rules will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any provision of these Rules is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions of the Rules will remain in full force and effect.</h5>
